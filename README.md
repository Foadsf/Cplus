# Cplus
all the things I wish C already had

1. dynamically allocated arrays
2. dynamically allocated multidimensional arrays
3. sets
4. passing the size of arrays to functions
5. opencl integration
6. pure C, no OOP!


requirements:

1. cross-platform
2. hardware agnostic
3. compiler agnostic
4. thread safe and Reentrant
