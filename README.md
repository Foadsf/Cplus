# Cplus
all the things I wish C already had

## Features:
1. dynamically allocated arrays
2. dynamically allocated multidimensional arrays (more info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730276/how-can-i-make-multidimensional-dynamically-allocated-arrays-in-c) )
3. sets
4. passing the size of arrays to functions
5. opencl integration (more info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50319531/opencl-how-to-distribute-a-calculation-on-different-devices-without-multithread) )
6. pure C, no OOP!
7. type detection


## Requirements:

1. cross-platform
2. hardware agnostic
3. compiler agnostic
4. thread safe and Reentrant
