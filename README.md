# Cplus
all the things I wish C already had

1. dynamically alocated arrays
2. dynamically allocated multidimentional arrays
3. sets
4. paasing the size of arrays to functions
5. opencl integration
6. pure C, no OOP!



1. cross-platform
2. hardware agnostic
3. compiler agnostic
4. thread safe and Reentrant
